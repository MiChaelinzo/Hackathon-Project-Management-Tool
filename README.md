A task management system to delegate and keep track of tasks within a team.
A real-time collaboration platform for team members to discuss, share and edit code, documents, and design assets.
A version control system to keep track of changes to code and project materials.
A presentation builder to create and share project presentations with judges and other participants.
Integration with commonly used tools such as GitHub, Google Drive, and Slack to streamline the hackathon experience.
This tool would aim to provide hackathon participants with a central hub for their project, making it easier for them to focus on what matters most â€“ building and presenting their idea.
